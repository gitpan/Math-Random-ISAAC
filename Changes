	Slight POD change

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	POD fixes

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	No longer test Perl::Critic during AUTOMATED_TESTING, only RELEASE_TESTING. Thanks to Elliot Shank for the discussion in a private mail.

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Math::Random::ISAAC::PP set back to version 1.0.4
	Math::Random::ISAAC set back to version 1.0.5
	(Last version released via CPAN was 1.0.4 of the package)

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Changed critic.rc to ignore PodSpelling policy (fixes a bug in Debian, BTS#538115 -- when Pod::Spell and other dependencies are installed)

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE -> LICENSE in POD

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- No more versioned dependency on version.pm
	- Updated Perl::Critic test

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Overhaul test scripts, remove author tests from Recommends (Alias' journal #5375)

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Update LICENSE and README to a smaller format. Clarify POD. No longer generates a readme using pod2text

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	All the copyrights now reference the main file, to reduce the number of things that need to be updated in case the years are updated

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fixed the copyright statement in LICENSE

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed CAVEATS from README
	- Updated copyright statements

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Bumped version to 1.0.6
	- Require Internet (TEST_INTERNET) to do the signature test, since it tries to download the key from a keyserver

2009-07-22  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Make it clearer in POD that there is no default seeding mechanism

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	No longer enforce "one dot only" in filenames. This breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	New perlcriticrc

2009-06-10  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Very minor change to the license header

2009-05-13  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated LICENSE (removed some old text)

2009-05-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Bumped version to 1.0.5

2009-05-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- New simplified license - Public Domain (fallback on MIT, Artistic-2+, GPL-2+ only)
	- Very minor documentation fixes

2009-04-26  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added .tmp to MANIFEST.SKIP

2009-04-26  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Updated version to 1.0.4

2009-04-26  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added some more tests for fallback functionality; I believe having 'use' for ISAAC meant that it would be put in a BEGIN{} block, which means selection happens before Test::Without::Module is even loaded (this was fixed by changing to require in an eval)
	-> Added a test to ensure the module was compiled/loaded, then check if $Math::Random::ISAAC::DRIVER is defined first

2009-04-24  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP for Win32 builds...

2009-04-23  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	One last oopsie, added a wrong examples file

2009-04-23  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Updated MANIFEST file

2009-04-06  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Changed pod-coverage to test all files

	- Updated version numbers for META.yml and Math::Random::ISAAC
	- Fixed the PurePerl algorithm to mask out high bits for 64-bit systems, so as to be portable

2009-04-03  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	swapped $got and $expected values for is()

2009-04-03  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added back generated_by (though I end up tweaking it by hand due to the version problem)

2009-03-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Disable warning about functions that look like builtins (rand, irand), since they are methods
	- Added stub POD for DESCRIPTION, SUPPORT in PP.pm
	- Changed variable names because $a, $b are reserved by 'sort'

2009-03-20  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added lots of documentation
	- Clarified the LICENSE - in particular, removed the (C) symbol to remove ambiguity
